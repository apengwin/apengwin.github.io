I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, where I majored in <a href="http://math.berkeley.edu">Applied Math</a> and <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/">Computer Science.</a></p>
<p>During undergrad, I was active in <a href="https://innovativedesign.club/">Innovative Design</a>, for better or for worse. I organized the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/InnovativeDesignUCB/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=979180395454086">CMYK Designathon</a> in 2015, co-led a photo <s>tier</s> team, and taught two photo decals. I was also involved with <a href="https://forum.berkeley.edu/">The Berkeley Forum</a> during its nascent years.</p>
<p>I'm interested in robotics, smart cities, and problems related to urban studies. My parents still don't understand why I was never a history and media studies major.</p>
<p>I previously worked as a research engineer at the UC Berkeley <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/">RISELab/AMPLab</a> on <a href="http://pywren.io/">pywren</a>. In a past life, I interned at <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a>.</p>
<p>The best way to get in touch with me is via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/allan.pengwin">Facebook Messenger</a>, where I'm notoriously always online. Alternatively, you can reach my email at megatron@berkeley.edu</p>
<p>Here are some more interesting important facts about me.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I wrote a Chrome extension that gives you the ability to <a href="https://github.com/apengwin/Instagram-Open-in-Tab">&ldquo;Open in New Tab&rdquo; on the Instagram website</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have the same birthday as Miley Cyrus.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I'm facebook friends with a former producer of the Oprah show who was in charge of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmCQ-V7c7Bc">the episode where they gave everyone a new Pontiac g6</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Charlie Brand, lead singer of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6TDP89a_rs">the Miniature Tigers</a>, gave me a piggy-back ride at one of their concerts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I once had dinner with creator of The Sopranos David Chase and his wife.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I got the four members of Hiatus Kaiyote to sign my copy of Lolita. I later got Nai Palm to sign it again.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I met the youngest ever PBA champion on a flight from Tokyo to Los Angeles.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I've watched every single Gordon Ramsay video on Youtube multiple times. In spite of this, <a href ="images/porridge.png" target="_blank">I am, by all measures, still a terrible cook.</a></p>
</li>
