<p>I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, where I majored in Applied Math and Computer Science. I'm interested in Distributed Systems, Computational Geometry, and Urban Studies, especially traffic flow theory. On the side, I enjoy music, filmmaking, and talking about feelings. </p>
<p>I'm currently working at the Berkeley RISELab/AMPLab on pywren. In a past life, I interned at Facebook and Linkedin.</p>
<p>The best way to get in touch with me is via Facebook Messenger, where I'm notoriously always online. Alternatively, you can reach my email at ude.yelekreb@nortagem</p>
<p>Here are some more interesting important facts about me.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I wrote a Chrome extension that gives you the ability to &ldquo;Open in New Tab&rdquo; on the Instagram website.</p>
</li>
<li><p></p>
</li>
<li><p>My favorite photographers are Olivia Bee, Yutaka Tanakashi, and Ernst Haas.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have the same birthday as Miley Cyrus.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I'm facebook friends with a former producer of the Oprah show who was in charge of the episode where they gave everyone a new Pontiac g6</p>
</li>
<li><p>Charlie Brand, lead singer of the Miniature Tigers, gave me a piggy-back ride at one of their concerts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I once had dinner with creator of The Sopranos David Chase and his wife.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At a Hiatus Kaiyote concert, I got the four members to autograph my copy of Lolita.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I met the youngest ever PBA champion on a flight from Tokyo to Los Angeles.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I almost died during the training level of League of Legends. I haven't touched the game since.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I recently beat my dad in Chinese Chess for the first time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I've watched every single Gordon Ramsay video on Youtube multiple times. In spite of this, I am, by all measures, still a terrible cook.</p>
