        I feel like "intersection" is the least meaningful buzz word in silicon valley. I'm interested in 20th century European History, Distributed Systems, Urban Planning, and computational geometry, but not at the same time, right? <br>I'm currently working with the Berkeley Rise Lab on <a href="http://pywren.io/" target="_blank">pywren</a>. In a past life, I interned at <a href="http://facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://linkedin.com" target="_blank" >Linkedin.</a>

        Here are some more <strike>interesting</strike> important facts about me.

        <ul>
        <li>My favorite photographers are <a href = "http://oliviabee.com/kids-in-love/kids-in-love-2/" target="_blank">Olivia Bee</a>, <a href="https://japan-photo.info/blog/2013/04/18/yutaka-takanashi-towards-the-city-including-a-short-history-of-the-provoke-era-part-i/" target="_blank">Yutaka Tanakashi</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ikko+narahara&espv=2&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZjbyVievSAhVQyGMKHVnjAr0Q_AUIBigB&biw=1152&bih=621&dpr=1.25" target="_blank">Ikko Narahara</a>.
        <li>I have the same birthday as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_23#Births" target="_blank"> Miley Cyrus</a>.
        <li><a href="images/cbrand.jpg" target="_blank">Charlie Brand</a>, lead singer of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6TDP89a_rs" target="_blank">Miniature Tigers</a>, gave me a piggy-back ride at one of their concerts.
        <li>I once had dinner with creator of The Sopranos David Chase  and his wife.
        <li>After a Hiatus Kaiyote concert, I waited to get autographs from members of the band, but realized that I didn't have anything for them to sign. <a href="images/lolita.jpg" target="_blank">So I had them autograph my copy of Lolita.</a>
        <li>I met the <a href="http://www.pba.com/Bowlers/Bowler/8678" target="_blank">youngest ever PBA champion</a> on a flight from Tokyo to Los Angeles.
