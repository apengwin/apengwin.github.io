        I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, majoring in Applied Math and Computer Science. While at Berkeley, I taught a decal on photography principles, and had the fortune of interning at <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://linkedin.com">Linkedin.</a>

        Here are some more <strike>interesting</strike> important facts about me.

        <ul>
        <li>My favorite photographers are <a href = "http://oliviabee.com/kids-in-love/kids-in-love-2/" >Olivia Bee</a>, <a href="https://japan-photo.info/blog/2013/04/18/yutaka-takanashi-towards-the-city-including-a-short-history-of-the-provoke-era-part-i/">Yutaka Tanakashi</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ikko+narahara&espv=2&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZjbyVievSAhVQyGMKHVnjAr0Q_AUIBigB&biw=1152&bih=621&dpr=1.25">Ikko Narahara</a>.
        <li>I have the same birthday as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_23#Births"> Miley Cyrus</a>.
        <li>Charlie Brand, lead singer of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6TDP89a_rs">Miniature Tigers</a>, gave me a piggy-back ride at one of their concerts.
        <li>I once had dinner with creator of The Sopranos, David Chase,  and his wife.
        <li>After a Hiatus Kaiyote concert, I waited to get autographs from members of the band, but realized that I didn't have anything for them to sign. <a href="images/lolita.jpg">So I had them autograph my copy of Lolita.</a>
        <li> I visited Europe last summer and <a href="https://medium.com/@allanthistogether/poorly-researched-bullshit-539ae7f65b5#.bkimig2uf">wrote a lot</a> when I was there.

        The best way to get in contact with me is via Facebook Messenger, on which I am notoriously always online.
