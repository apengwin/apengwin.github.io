         I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, where I majored in Applied Math and Computer Science. I'm interested in Distributed Systems, Computational Geometry, and Urban Studies. On the side, I enjoy music, filmmaking, and talking about feelings.

<br>I'm currently working at the <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu//"target="_blank">Berkeley RISELab</a> on <a href="http://pywren.io/" target="_blank">pywren</a>. In a past life, I interned at <a href="http://facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://linkedin.com" target="_blank" >Linkedin.</a>
        </div>
        <br>
        Here are some more <strike>interesting</strike> important facts about me.

        <ul>
        <li>My favorite photographers are <a href = "http://oliviabee.com/kids-in-love/kids-in-love-2/" target="_blank">Olivia Bee</a>, <a href="https://japan-photo.info/blog/2013/04/18/yutaka-takanashi-towards-the-city-including-a-short-history-of-the-provoke-era-part-i/" target="_blank">Yutaka Tanakashi</a>, and <a href="http://www.ernst-haas.com/new-york-2.html" target="_blank">Ernst Haas</a>.
        <li>I have the same birthday as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_23#Births" target="_blank"> Miley Cyrus</a>.
        <li>I'm facebook friends with a former producer of the Oprah show who was in charge of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmCQ-V7c7Bc" target="_blank">episode where they gave everyone a new Pontiac g6</a>
        <li><a href="images/cbrand.jpg" target="_blank">Charlie Brand</a>, lead singer of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6TDP89a_rs" target="_blank">Miniature Tigers</a>, gave me a piggy-back ride at one of their concerts.
        <li>I once had dinner with creator of The Sopranos David Chase  and his wife.
        <li>After a Hiatus Kaiyote concert, I waited to get autographs from members of the band, but realized that I didn't have anything for them to sign. <a href="images/lolita.jpg" target="_blank">So I had them autograph my copy of Lolita.</a>
        <li>I met the <a href="http://www.pba.com/Bowlers/Bowler/8678" target="_blank">youngest ever PBA champion</a> on a flight from Tokyo to Los Angeles.
