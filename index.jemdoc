I'm currently working at [https://databricks.com/ Databricks], and previously worked at [https://mod9.io/docs Mod9], working on speech recognition.

I graduated from UC Berkeley, where I majored in [http://math.berkeley.edu Applied Math] and [https://eecs.berkeley.edu/ Computer Science.]

During undergrad, I was active in [https://innovativedesign.club/ Innovative Design], for better or for worse. I organized the [https://www.facebook.com/pg/InnovativeDesignUCB/photos/?tab=album&album_id=979180395454086 CMYK Designathon] in 2015, co-led a photo {{<s>tier</s>}} team, and taught two photo decals. I was also involved with [https://forum.berkeley.edu/ The Berkeley Forum] during its nascent years.

I'm interested in distributed systems, signal processing, and problems related to urban studies. My parents still don't understand why I was never a history and media studies major.

The best way to get in touch with me is via [https://www.facebook.com/allan.pengwin Facebook Messenger], where I'm notoriously always online. Alternatively, you can reach my email at megatron@berkeley.edu
