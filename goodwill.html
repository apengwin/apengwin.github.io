<div id="intro">
In Fall 2016,  we conducted an ethnographic survey of a local Goodwill second-hand store and proposed a redesign of the existing space.

<br><br>
Through interviews, on-site surveys, various sketches of the current layout, and an extensive survey of research literature on related economic and sociological issues related to department stores and second-hand stores, we developed an understanding of the related community, and culture around second-hand stores.
<br><br>
We proposed a re-design of the space, emphasizing discovery of new clothing items, and a unisex layout, eliminating gender divisions of clothing. The proposal was selected to be presented at the <a href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2017-fall-arch-110ac-001-lec-001">Architecture 110</a>class at UC Berkeley, and was praised as "radical", by renowned architectrue professor and ethnographic researcher <a href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/galen-cranz">Galen Cranz</a>.
