<p>In Fall 2016, we conducted an ethnographic survey of a local Goodwill second-hand store and proposed a redesign of the existing space. </p>
<p>Through interviews, on-site surveys, various sketches of the current layout, and an extensive survey of research literature on related economic and sociological issues related to department stores and second-hand stores, we developed an understanding of the related community, and culture around second-hand stores. </p>
<p>We proposed a re-design of the space, emphasizing discovery of new clothing items, and a unisex layout, eliminating gender divisions of clothing. The proposal was selected to be presented at the Architecture 110class at UC Berkeley, and was praised as &ldquo;radical&rdquo;, by renowned architectrue professor and ethnographic researcher Galen Cranz.</p>
